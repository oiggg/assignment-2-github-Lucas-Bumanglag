Title: 'The Farmer's Daughter'

There was an old farmer who lived on a rock
He sat in the meadow just shaking his
Fist at some boys who were down by the crick
Their feet in the water, their hands on their
Marbles and playthings, and at half past four
There came a young lady, she looked like a
Pretty young creature, she sat on the grass
She pulled up her dress, and she showed them her
Ruffles and laces and white fluffy duck
She said she was learning a new way to
Bring up her children so they would not spit
While the boys in the barnyard were shoveling
Refuse and litter from yesterday's hunt
While the girl in the meadow was rubbing her
Eyes at the fellow down by the dock
He looked like a man with a sizable
Home in the country with a big fence out front
And if he asked her politely, she'd show him her
Little pet dog who was subject to fits
And maybe she'd let him grab hold of her
Small tender hand with a movement so quick
And then she'd bend over and suck on his
Candy, so tasty, ade of butterscotch
And then he'd spread whipped cream all over her
Cookies that she had left out on her shelf
If you think this is dirty, you can go fudge yourself!

May isang matandang magsasaka na nakatira sa bato
Umupo siya sa parang, nakatungo ang kamao
Sa ilang batang naglalaro sa tabi ng batis
Ang mga paa nila sa tubig, ang mga kamay sa
Mga laruan at bola, at bandang alas-kuwatro y medya
Dumating ang isang dalagang bata, mukhang
Maganda at masigla, umupo siya sa damuhan
Ipinakita niya ang kanyang mga kasuotan,
Mga ruffles at tela na puti at malambot
Sabi niyaâ€™y natututo siyang bagong paraan
Para alagaan ang mga bata nang maayos
Habang ang mga bata sa bakuran ay naglalaro
At naglilinis mula sa huling araw ng laro
Habang ang dalaga sa parang ay nagmamasid sa paligid
